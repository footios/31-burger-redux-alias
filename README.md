This project is a modified version of the project of this course: 

[React 16.6 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)


We use: 
* React Hooks,
* Object destructuring in props,
* `index.js` for all files (in their particular folder) and we export them like: `export default () => {...}`
